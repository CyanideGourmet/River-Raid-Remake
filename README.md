# River-Raid-Remake
Remake of a classic '80s game River Raid, developed by a group of 4 aspiring gamedevs from a polish gamedev school located in Warsaw. The main and only purpose of this project is learning the process of creating a game.
A 2 month-long project, based around remaking a game already made by others.
